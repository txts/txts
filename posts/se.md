<h1>About this class</h1>


The class is designed about the following definition.
Software engineering is the 

+ _process_ of the
+ _design_,
+ _construction_ and
+ _maintenance_ of
+ _good  enough_
+ _software_,
+ given the _available resources_.

The last point means that we are always trading off between
what we want with
what we need with what we've got. _Software engineers_, therefore
are the people we look to:

+ _Make_ and
+ _justify_
+ _well-informed decisions_ 
+ about _trade-offs_
+ in software engineering.

This, in turn means that at any time, software engineering are
aware of _multiple possibilities_ and the _reasons_ why we should be doing
one, and not the others. To enable this, students of SE can:

+ _Strategy 0: STUDY!_ Build up their background knowledge about SE;
+ _Strategy 1: READ!_ Using the literature, extend that knowledge by _reading widely_ and making
  some adjudication about all that material.  
+ _Strategy 2: MINE!_: Using data science, collect and analyze project data;
+ _Strategy 3: BUILD!_: Using software construction tools, consider multiple designs (perhaps via some prototyping.

To support _Strategy 0_, this class runs a lecture series reviewing the field of SE.

To support the other strategies, this class runs a class project with three tracks
(one for each strategy).
