Your task is, as a group, to assess products from three different groups.

Work as a team (since the aim here is to spend time reflecting
on other the work of other people).

## Preparation

Read the UML versions of game of life groups 3 other groups.

View Diederich talk on [Stop Writing Classes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9pEzgHorH0&feature=youtu.be&app=desktop) (30 mins). Note that the
speaker defines Game of Life in 13 lines of code.

Re-read the Parnas paper [On the criteria for dividing systems into modules](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cs.umd.edu%2Fclass%2Fspring2003%2Fcmsc838p%2FDesign%2Fcriteria.pdf&ei=icy6VNnrNq_IsQTkx4HgDg&usg=AFQjCNHu8GZOjZDIJUxRDZIp2bHOFV-aWw&sig2=cv3hwluIXdo8vmAmkzaPLw&bvm=bv.83829542,d.cWc)

## To do


### Add to the rubric

For the projects you review, add a grade to the rubric representing your group's view.

### List the design rules

Compile together the design review rules proposed by those groups plus your own design review rules.

+ Score each rule as _good_ (yes, we will will always reflect on this one in the future) or
+ _Maybe_ in that you have some issues with that rule. Write down what are those issues.


### Comment 

As a group, write a (very very) short report:

+ Has Diederich implemented Game of Life in 11 lines? Anything missing in his design?
+ Are the classes written by Diederich the same as the modules proposed by Parnas? Explain.
+ Consider the following two quotes from Diederich. Something about them, I believe, would give Parnas a heart attack
  and suggest that software development in 2015 is somewhat different to how Parnas imagined it in 1972. Can you see what that is? Explain.

     + "_Anything you use someone else's code, you have to read it._"  
     + "_Anytime some updates the code you use, you have to do a diff and see what they have changed._"
