title: Homework1, part B
---


Your task is, as a group, to assess products from three different groups.

Work as a team (since the aim here is to spend time reflecting
on other people's work).

Check out their Git and test if their slides build.

Fill in their homework rubric.

Read their slides and reflect on their proposed project:

Write a (very very) short report that...

+ For some part of the project, list technical options, with some potentional pros and cons for each
+ Suggests any freely available tools that handle, say, the first half of the implementation (thus bootstrapping the students further into the project.)
+ Propose some change to the project that doubles the scope (effort);
+ Propose some change to the project that halves the scope.
+ Comment on the scope (effort) of the project compared across your own proposed scope and that of the 3 projects you are reviewing.

## What to hand in

For each of the three projects your review:

+ A stapled bundle of two items
+ The original homework 1a from the other group
      + On the rubric for that homework, _one_ column filled in with your score
+ A second piece of paper with your very very short report
