## Review Questions

UML

+ Draw a UML class for a Point containing an _x,y_ location,
  and a method that returns the distance of this point to one other point.
+ Draw a small example of a UML sequence diagram. What 
  kind of UML items appear in the columns?
+ Draw a small example of a UML state transition diagram.
  Where do method names appear on that diagram.
+ What is God class? What do you do with it?
+ Someone offers you a design of an employee record system. 
  On the screen is one God class for Employe with all database, 
  Gui, searching methods. An experienced designer looks over your 
  shoulder and says “that design needs 3 to 5 more classes”. 
  What are they? What rules are you applying to modify the 
  original  1 class design?


Pattern

+ What is pattern? 
+ Redesign the class hierarchy browser and the disk browser with the composite pattern below.

+ Given the observer pattern pattern shown below,
  how would you implement dialog- model separation?
+ The same folder is displayed twice on the screen. With your 
  mouse you click the name of one folder in one window and change it. 
  Then the name of the folder changes in another window. Use the subject 
  observer pattern, describe how this is implemented.
