## Automated Model-based Software Engineering

Review: http://goo.gl/0lzxh3

+  In "model-based SE", developers code up some understanding of "it" (whatever "it" is) 
   and then explore that model.
       + How is this different to non-model-based SE
       + In your everyday life, give one example of how a model-based system might effect
         you.
	 

## SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINES

Review at http://goo.gl/0lzxh3 (p18-21)

![spl](../img/spl.png)

+ How to generate one product from this model?
+ What are the dashed lines in the above model?
+ What are the required properties of this product line? (hint, see last question)
+ Given a product line with 10 features and 3 horizontal dashed lines, how hard is it to 
       generate a valid product?
+ Give a product line with 10,000 features and 300,000 horizontal dashed lines,
       how hard is it to generate a valid product? Why?


## Genetic algorithms

Review GAs at http://goo.gl/0lzxh3 (p8 to p13).

Recall that GAs execute over arrays of choices. Each choice is an individual. Each
  cell in that individual is a commitment to one options (e.g. choice1(car)=(red,4wheels,gasMotor),
  choice2(car)=blue,2wheels,electricMotor)).

Genetic algorithms run for N generations where
  each generation contains hundreds to thousands of randomly selected individuals.
  
Genetic algorithms have three operators (select, crossover, mutate). For each operator:


+ Write a two line definition
+ Using     the above examples of cars, show how that operator would apply. 
+ Write down what would happen if we did *not* use that operator,

### GENPROG (an example GA)

Review GENPROG at http://goo.gl/0lzxh3 (p14-17).

Recall that
GENPROG is a program repair system. It has to parts: scoring and fixing:

+ Draw a parse tree of `if a*3 + b/c else d/(e+0.0001)`. 
+ Given the test case a=b=d=e=1 and c=0, show how GENPROG scores each node in the parse tree.
+ Given those scores, how does GENPROG use genetic algorithms to find the fix (hint: the fix is to
always add a small amount to any denominator that might be zero).

### NIGHTHAWK (an example GA)
In simplistic GAs for test case generation, the population comprises randomly generated program inputs (and GAs try
  cross over and mutation to build better test cases). NIGHTHAWK is a GA that tries to create test cases
  that cover most lines of code in the program.
  
+ NIGHTHAWK was designed to address the problem of randomly generating tests that enter a block
     of code guarded by `if (x==y) then..` where `x` and `y` are real-valued variables. Why is this a problem?
     Note that your answer should comment on the range of `x` and the range of `y`.
+ NIGHTHAWK mutates a sequence of unit tests of the form   
    `a:= F1(); b:= F2(a); c:= F3(a,b);...`
     Why does this approach simplify NIGHTHAWK's test case generation.


## SPIRAL MODEL

Review: http://goo.gl/Ho4cID (slides 23,24,25)

+ Using a diagram, define the spiral model.
+ What is the connection between the spiral model and
     + Traditional Royce-style software development?
     + Beck-style agile development?
+ In the spiral model, what is commit partition?
+ During requirements engineering, how to define the commit partition?
+ Draw Brooks' v-diagram. List what kind of artifacts generated early in the life cycle
  might be used later in the life cycle.
     
## Requirement engineering

Review at http://goo.gl/Ho4cID

+ UML is a notation often used by programmers to describe their system. 
     + Draw an sample UML diagram with at least 3 classes
     + Define all visual terms in that diagram
+ Distinguish between hard goals and soft goals. For a software system, give one example of each.
+ SOFTGOALS review at http://goo.gl/Ho4cID (p41 to p45).  
  SOFTGOALS are a notation  used by requirements engineers to describe early life cycle requirements.
     + Draw an sample soft goal diagram with at least 3 soft goals and one hard-goal.
     + Define all visual terms in that diagram
     + When discussing early life-cycle requirements with users, why might soft goals be a better notation than UML?
+ Functional requirements:
     + List four different kinds of stake holders for an aeroplane
     + For each kind, list:
        + one functional requirement that is very important to them, but the others
          just do not care about.
        + One non-functional requirement for which two stake holders might have different opinions.
+ Non-functional requirements
     + List some "ilities" for a software system
     + Consider a pen:
       + List two functional requirements for a pen
       + List two non-functional requirements for a pen.
+ What does YAGNI say about requirements engineering?

## Testing

+ For structural,  functional and model-based testing.
    + Define and distinguish each term
    + Write one one advantage and one disadvantage compared to the over two.	
+ Draw a Finite State machine with at least 6 states and 3 guards on some transitions
+ Given the above model:
   + Write down a useless test (one that will never exercise the finite state machine).
   + Write down useful tests (that cover all parts of the finite state machine).
+ Most tests occur in a limited number of nearby locations. Given this:
   + Proposed an optimized black-box testing regime
+ All pairs testing
    + If we perform exhaustive tests of a function with three boolean inputs, how many tests will be involved?
    + Define it pairs testing and why it might be useful, and why it might be useless.
    + You have been asked to check if the LISP function `ipo` is working correctly.
      Is the following output correct? If not, fix it (HINT: ipo is an
      all pairs test generator).

````
    > (ipo '(2 2 2))                                           
       ((2 2 1) (2 2 2) (1 2 2) (1 1 1))
