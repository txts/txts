title: Homework2: UML
---

Due Feb 3.

## Setup

+ Download and install [StarUML](http://staruml.io/)
+ Review the website [Conway's Game of Life](http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/)
+ Recall the [rules for Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Rules)
+ Consider the [GOL UML design v1](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s14/sh/f4f0b03f-4f57-42fb-8a1e-db9a3235d522/ad332a2c5889878b/res/e7343116-cfb5-44d3-b538-3f88535914c4.png?resizeSmall&width=832)

## Individually

+ Using StarUML, design your own GOL UML design v2.

## As a group

+ Once all the v2 designs are made,
+ Meet to review all designs and create your group GOL UML design v3
+ As you create v3, write down the rules you used to say 
  "this part of this v2 needs to be changed to that".
  
## Hand in:

Your v2 and v3 designs. _Do not write your individual name on your v2 design_.

Specifically, I want to see, stapled together, in order:

+ [Rubric2](rubric2.html), one column filled in
+ **All** your v2 designs (one per person)
+ Your v3 design
+ The most revised v2 design (that is most different to the v3 design).
+ The rules that guided you from v2 to v3. 
     + Number each rule.
	 + On the print out of the designs, add that number in **red**
	   pen where it is relevant to v3 and the most revised v2 design
+ All the other v2 designs.
